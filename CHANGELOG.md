# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `substrate add` now supports non-interactive input channels:
  - `--body TEXT` / `-b` — inline body string
  - `--from FILE` / `-f` — read body from a file path
  - `--from -` — read body from stdin (pipe-friendly)
  - `--edit` — force open `$EDITOR` after pre-fill (otherwise editor is skipped when a body source is provided)
- `_resolve_body()` helper for resolving content from `--body`/`--from`, including stdin and frontmatter-stripping when the source file already has YAML frontmatter.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- `substrate ui` — static HTML dashboard with day-grouped timeline, 30-day activity bar chart, "most referenced" leaderboard, tag filter chips, and a modal form to draft new bundles via copy-paste-able shell heredoc.
- `SUBSTRATE_ACTIVE_FILE` env var — point at any markdown file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, custom) where an `ACTIVE BUNDLE` marker declares the current active bundle. Dashboard highlights it.
- `SUBSTRATE_ACTIVE_MARKER` env var — customize the marker text (default: `ACTIVE BUNDLE`).
- "Most referenced" score computed without `log_use` dependency: mentions in the active file × 4 + git commit count + (legacy `log_use` count × 2) + active-session bonus.

### Changed
- README rewritten for open-source release; removed personal examples and internal references.
- Active-session detection is no longer hardcoded to any personal file path.

### Fixed
- Bundles without YAML frontmatter now get their id reconstructed as `{date}-{stem}` so they match active-session references and external-file path-extracted ids.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Initial CLI: `init`, `add`, `list`, `search`, `get`, `use`, `log`, `edit`, `history`.
- MCP server (`substrate-mcp`) exposing `list_bundles`, `get_bundle`, `search_bundles`, `get_by_date`, `log_use`.
- Git-backed bundle store under `~/.substrate/` (override via `SUBSTRATE_HOME`).
- Markdown + YAML frontmatter bundle format.
- Append-only `usage.log` as the falsifiable retrieval metric.
